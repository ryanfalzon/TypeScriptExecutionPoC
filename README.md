# TypeScript Execution PoC

This is a POC project that allows Typescript scripts to be compiled and executed from within a .NET environment. <br />
As an example I took the case of needing to compile a Solidity smart contract from a C# console application. <br />
Use cases for such a case would include the use of packages which have not yet been developed and pushed to NuGet but are already available to NPM.
